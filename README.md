Google Drive ZIP to GitHub Repository Exporter
This Colab notebook provides a streamlined workflow to take a ZIP file from your Google Drive and push its contents into a new or existing GitHub repository.

What This Tool Does
It automates the entire process of getting source code or other project files from a Drive link into a version-controlled repository on GitHub.

Required Preparation
Before you begin, you will need three things:

A Google Drive Link: A sharable link to the .zip file you want to upload. This can be a standard Drive link or a link from an application like AI Studio.
A GitHub Repository: A repository (either new or existing, public or private) on GitHub to push the files to.
A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT): A PAT with repo scope is required for the notebook to authenticate with GitHub.
The Three-Step Workflow
Step 1: Get File from Google Drive

You will provide the link to your file.
The notebook authenticates with your Google account and downloads the file's content into the Colab environment.
Step 2: Unpack the ZIP Archive

This step verifies the downloaded file is a valid ZIP archive.
It then unpacks the contents into a clean folder, ready to be committed to Git.
Step 3: Push Contents to GitHub Repository

You will provide your GitHub details and the name of a Colab Secret (ðŸ”‘) where your PAT is stored.
The notebook clones your repository, copies the project files into it, and pushes the new commit back to GitHub.
